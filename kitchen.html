                <h3><p>Whether you believe that the kitchen is the heart of the home or not, you can't deny that it is a hub of activity.<br>
                    From cooking up our favourite meals, nourishing our bodies and learning to bake with mum to doing homework with our children, <br>
                    hosting and entertaining friends, and using it as a place to converse over a steaming cup of tea. <br>
                    The kitchen is undoubtedly the most used room in the home and a place that is full of memories.
                    <br>Is your kitchen the heart of your home? Do you have special memories in the kitchen that stir up some real nostalgia?</p>
